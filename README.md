# Pet Management API

## Project Description

This project is an API developed with Python using the **FastAPI** framework. The goal is to provide an efficient system for managing information about pets, allowing for the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of data related to dogs and their procedures at pet shops.

## Key Features

- **Secure Authentication**: Utilizes **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for secure and efficient authentication, allowing restricted access to certain API routes.
- **Containerization with Docker**: Configured to run in Docker containers, simplifying the setup of the development environment and deployment.
- **Modular Structure**: Follows a modular architecture, separating routes, services, and models for better organization and maintainability.
- **Interactive Documentation**: Automatically generated documentation by FastAPI, enabling developers to easily interact with the API through a web interface.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- FastAPI
- Docker
- PostgreSQL (for data storage)
- JWT (for authentication)
